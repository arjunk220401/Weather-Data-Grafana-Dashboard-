# Managerial Insights 

## Weather Pattern Monitoring:

i) Current Rain Today Status shows 57, indicating moderate rainfall conditions that require attention for weather-dependent operations.

ii) Real-time humidity readings of 0.800 and 0.574 suggest high moisture content in the air, which could impact indoor climate control systems.

iii) Temperature variation graph shows consistent fluctuation between 20-25°C over time periods (01:10 to 01:30), indicating stable thermal conditions
Maximum temperature of 40.4° suggests the need for heat stress management protocols during peak hours.

## Resource Management:

i) Sunshine value of 5.19 hours versus evaporation rate of 67.2 indicates high evaporation despite moderate sunshine, suggesting efficient water management strategies are needed

ii) The dashboard shows significant wind variation (35 units in wind gust data), which could be leveraged for renewable energy planning during peak wind periods

iii) Temperature patterns shown in the real-time variation graph can help optimize HVAC system operations across different time periods

## Risk Assessment:

i) Extreme Wind Gust Events graph shows multiple spikes reaching 50 units between 01:10-01:30, indicating potential safety risks for outdoor operations

ii) The humidity-pressure relationship display (shown in bar format) reveals periodic fluctuations that could signal approaching weather changes

iii) Wind speeds comparison across locations (shown in the colored bands: green, yellow, blue, orange) helps identify high-risk zones requiring different safety protocols
